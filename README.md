# chjdkver

## What is this?

It is difficult to switch jdk version on OS X environment which
contains several jdk versions.  Because, the relation among symbolic
links is quite complex.

This program simply switches jdk versions.

## Usage

### Preparation

Oracle JDKs are installed into `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`.
This program shows only files whose name is contained numbers, dot(.),
hyphen, and underbar.  Therefore, use symbolic link.

    $ cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
    $ ls -F
    jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/    jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/
    $ chjdkver
    $ sudo ln -s jdk1.7.0_45.jdk ./1.7
    $ sudo ln -s jdk1.8.0_20.jdk ./1.8
    $ ls -F
    1.7@             1.8@             jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/ jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/
    $ chjdkver
    1.7 (*)
    1.8

Note that,
`/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Commands` must
be linked to `../CurrentJDK/Contents/Home/bin`.  Because
`/usr/bin/java` and etc. are symblic linked to
`/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Commands/java`,
and the `A` directory is not symbolic link.

    $ cd /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A
    $ sudo mv Commands Commands.back
    $ sudo ln -s ../CurrentJDK/Contents/Home/bin ./Commands

### Switch JDK

    $ java -version
    java version "1.7.0_45"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
    $ chjdkver
    1.7 (*)
    1.8
    $ sudo chjdkver 1.8
    $ java -version
    java version "1.8.0_20-ea"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-ea-b05)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b05, mixed mode)
    $ chjdkver
    1.7
    1.8 (*)

## Future work

* Do initial settings.
